This document outlines the approach taken to solve the tasks related to creating a RESTful API for user authentication, post management, and comment management in a Node.js application using Express and Mongoose. The tasks involved creating various controllers, validation middleware, and handlers for user authentication, post creation, and comment management.

Approach
1. Setting Up the Project
Dependencies: Installed necessary dependencies such as Express, Mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, and others.
Project Structure: Organized the project structure into models, controllers, and middlewares directories.
2. User Authentication
User Model: Created a User model with fields for username, email, password, and imageUrl.
Validation: Implemented request validation using express-validator for user registration and login.
Authentication Middleware: Created middleware to verify JWT tokens and attach the user to the request object.
3. User Controller
Register User: Implemented a handler for user registration, including password hashing and checking for existing users.
Login User: Implemented a handler for user login, including password verification and JWT token generation.
Logout User: Created a handler to clear the authentication cookie.
4. Post Management
Post Model: Created a Post model with fields for author, title, content, category, upVotes, downVotes, imageUrl, and comments.
Create Post: Implemented a handler to create a post, including user authorization and optional image upload.
Get Post by ID: Implemented a handler to fetch a post by its ID, including populating the author and comments.
Upvote and Downvote: Created handlers to upvote and downvote posts, ensuring users can only vote once per post.
Edit and Delete Post: Implemented handlers to allow users to edit and delete their own posts.
5. Comment Management
Comment Model: Created a Comment model with fields for postId, author, content, and replies.
Create Comment: Implemented a handler to create a comment on a post.
Get Comments: Implemented a handler to fetch comments for a post.
Reply to Comment: Created a handler to reply to a comment.
Get Comment Replies: Implemented a handler to fetch replies to a comment.
6. Validation Middleware
Used express-validator to validate incoming requests for user registration, post creation, and comment creation.
Added middleware to handle validation errors and provide meaningful responses to the client.
Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: TypeScript Types for JWT
Problem: Ensuring correct TypeScript types for JWT payloads and request objects.
Solution: Created a custom type for the JWT payload and extended the Express Request interface to include the user property.
Challenge 2: Handling Upvotes and Downvotes
Problem: Ensuring users can only upvote or downvote a post once.
Solution: Added arrays in the Post model to track users who have upvoted or downvoted and checked these arrays before allowing additional votes.
Challenge 3: Populating Nested Documents
Problem: Populating nested documents (e.g., comments and their replies) in a single query.
Solution: Used Mongoose's populate method with nested populate options to fetch the necessary data in one query.
Conclusion
The project successfully implemented a robust RESTful API for user authentication, post management, and comment management. The use of TypeScript, Mongoose, and Express ensured type safety, efficient data handling, and clear separation of concerns. The main challenges were related to type definitions and ensuring proper data relationships, which were overcome with thoughtful schema design and TypeScript integration.
